-As a teenager who is always wanting to up to date to trends, I want to browse a variety of products, so that I can find and purchase items that match my style and budget.
-As someone who is trying to make money from clothes that I don't wear anymore, I want to list my products easily, so that I can reach potential buyers and make sales.
-As someone who always love to shop and check things online whenever I am free, I want to add items to my favorites, so that I can revisit and purchase them later.
-As someone who is indecisive and take too long while choosing, I want to add items to my cart, so that I can quickly check out when ready.
-As an online shopper who loves checking online shopping websites, I want to follow other users, so that I can stay updated on their new listings.
-As a shopper, I want to leave reviews for sellers, so that I can share my experience and help others make informed decisions and other people's reviews will make me trust the seller too!
-As a start-up seller, I want to receive ratings and reviews, so that I can build credibility, gain more trust and attract more buyers.
-As a user who don't know how to use new websites that much, I want chatbot assistance, so that I can get instant help whenever I need it.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
