We followed a user-centric design approach, creating wireframes and mockups to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience.

## Testing

1. Login/Sign-up page
- 1.Try to log in with an account that have not signed in yet, an error msg or alert pop up will appear.
- 2.After that if you try to sign up, you cannot just put anyhow you want, you must put our password validations (like 8 charaters limitand other validations), if not error message about the field will appear.
- 3.After validations, if you successfully log in, the successful message will appear.
- 3. We also have captcha, so if you never do captcha properly, the error message will show to try captcha again.
2. Cart
- 1. If you try to add item into cart more than the available stock, it will not work.  
  2. So you can just put inside the cart only available stocks.
  3.  The max per transaction is 3 so if you maximise more than 3, you will not be able to process.  
3. Sell Page
4. Location
- 1. If location is not found in sell page, the alert/error message will show.
  

We added media in css so it works on different browsers and screen sizes and will make the user easy to use on different platforms.

We don't have any bugs but we sometimes have api error for some part.
